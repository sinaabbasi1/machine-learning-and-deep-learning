# ðŸ¤– Machine Learning / Deep Learning
This repository contains the assignments and their solutions for the Machine/Deep Learning course at TeIAS, with implementations using PyTorch and Scikit-learn. 

## Assignments
 
### Assignment 1: Theoretical Foundations of Machine Learning
  - Linear regression with closed-form solution for both one- and multi-dimensional outputs.
  - Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimation.
  - Bias-Variance trade-off

### Assignment 2: Regression and Model Optimization
  - Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Gradient Descent, and Regularization techniques.

### Assignment 3: Neural Networks and Training Challenges
  - Neural Network implementation, training, and addressing the vanishing gradient problem.

### Assignment 4: RNNs and LSTMs
  - Implementation and training of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks on various datasets.

### Assignment 5: Advanced Applications in Deep Learning
  -  Image segmentation using the Encoder-Decoder framework, and fine-tuning BERT for sentiment analysis using the Hugging Face Trainer.
